# City-of-Chicago-Workforce-Analysis
In this exercise I  analyzed the city of Chicago's workforce
In this exercise I wanted to showcase my Python experience by slicing the data for the city of Chicago by department and then further analyzing the largest departments.
The data set was downloaded from Kaggle and uploaded & updated by the city of Chicago as part of their transparency initiative as a public organization.
The Python file includes code to export data to a CSV file and from here i can easily update the file by refreshing it and then visualizing the data on Tableau Public.
